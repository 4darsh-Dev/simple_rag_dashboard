Hey, Welcome to the frontend.

### CSS guidelines

- Currently we are not using any UI component libraries instead we are using tailwind css library with [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/). Converting raw html code to jsx using [htmltojsx-parser](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) and use that. I am thinking to use flowbite-react in future. To maintain uniformity I recommened using the above methods only.
