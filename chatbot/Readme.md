Chatbot: 
This repository houses the code for an embeddable chatbot, which can be added to any website. 
It's marked as completed, meaning the basic functionality is already in place. 
However, there are a couple of pending tasks:
Integrating APIs from the backend to make the chatbot fully functional.
Improving code readability by organizing it into separate files for better maintenance.
Chatbot_RJS: This repository is dedicated to the development of a React application, presumably the website where the chatbot will be embedded.
Node_Server: This repository contains the backend code written in Node.js, which powers both the chatbot and the Chatbot_RJS application. 
It likely handles tasks such as managing user interactions, processing data, and integrating with external APIs.
